# Payload-Aware Energy–Time Optimization of UR10 Trajectories via Hybrid NSGA-II–MOPSO

This paper develops a hybrid NSGA-II–MOPSO framework for multi-objective trajectory planning of industrial UR10 robots operating under varying payloads. Joint-space motion is parameterized with B-spline waypoints and optimized to minimize total electrical energy and cycle time while satisfying joint position, velocity, and torque limits for light and heavy payload scenarios. The hybrid approach first exploits MOPSO’s exploratory capabilities to populate an external archive and then refines the resulting Pareto front using NSGA-II with elitist selection, crossover, and mutation. Numerical experiments in MATLAB’s Robotics System Toolbox show that the proposed hybrid consistently attains Pareto fronts with larger hypervolume, lower generational distance, and improved spread compared with stand-alone MOPSO and NSGA-II, demonstrating superior convergence and diversity. Detailed analysis of the selected knee solutions reveals how increased payload steepens the energy–time trade-off, substantially amplifying actuator torques and energy consumption even for comparable cycle times. An automatic knee-point detection procedure delivers practically relevant, energy–time efficient trajectories that can be directly exploited in industrial robot programming, supporting payload-aware scheduling, energy budgeting, and preventive maintenance decisions in high-throughput manufacturing environments.
